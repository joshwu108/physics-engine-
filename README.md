# Parallax Physics

2D physics engine with constraint-based simulation. Building this to learn more about physics engines and parallel computing.

## Planned Features

- Rigid body dynamics
- Constraint solver (distance, hinge, springs)
- Spatial hashing for collisions
- Multi-threading support
- Demos with ragdolls, cloth, etc.

## Building

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

## TODO
- [ ] Basic math library (Vec2, Mat2)
- [ ] Rigid body implementation
- [ ] Constraint system
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Renderer
- [ ] Demo scenes
